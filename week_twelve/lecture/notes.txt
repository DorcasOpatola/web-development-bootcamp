Installing Nextjs
-----------------
Automatic Installtion: npx create-next-app@latest

What is npx:
In Node.js, "npx" stands for "Node Package eXecute" and is a 
command-line utility that allows you to run any JavaScript 
package available on the npm registry directly without needing 
to install it globally on your system first; essentially, 
it lets you execute packages "on-demand" from the npm registry.

Key points about npx:
-  No need for global installation:
-  You can use npx to run a package even if you haven't installed it globally on your machine, making it convenient for one-off tasks or trying out new tools.
    
Comes with npm:
- npx is bundled with npm version 5.2 and above, so you likely already have it available if you're using a recent version of Node.js.

After the prompts, 'create-next-app' will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

Likely Issues/Errors
---------------------
1. Parsing error within your source code
    - cannot find module next/babel
        - This is ESLint error 
        - ESLint is a static code analysis tool that helps development teams identify and fix issues in JavaScript and JSX code (Read more: https://eslint.org/)
        - Solution: update .eslintrc.json file (Read more: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68163385/parsing-error-cannot-find-module-next-babel)

2. In case you run into permission issues on running your project (eg '.next' folder not being created), 
    run the command: 
        i. `ls -la` to check ownership of the application directory
        ii. `sudo chown -R $USER <project_directory>` to change ownership of the project folder

3. Hydration failed error on brower: 
    - Read more https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/24519#issuecomment-1122780621
    - May also be caused by brower extensions: 
       i. https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error
       ii. https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1gabiqn/hydration_error_when_installing_nextjs_15/?rdt=41386
    - Alternate solution: 
        update layout.js file - <html lang='en' suppressHydrationWarning>
        * This didn't work for me. Extensions were my issues.
    - Note: this only happens in dev mode, not in production
    - In case the error bothers you, you can also run your browser in incognito mode/private browswing mode
        * This disables all extensions
