            /** [5]. State and hooks 
                - React has a set of functions called hooks.
                - Hooks allow you to add additional logic such as state to your components. 
                - You can think of state as any information in your UI that changes over time, usually triggered by user interaction.
                - The React hook used to manage state is called: useState()
            **/

            //- [5.1]: Add useState() to your project.
            //- It returns an array, and you can access and use those array values inside your component using array destructuring
            //- i.  The first item in the array is the state "value", which you can name anything. It's recommended to name it something descriptive:
            //- ii. The second item in the array is a setter function to update the value. You can name the update function anything, 
                            //- but it's common to prefix it with "set" followed by the name of the state variable you're updating
            //- iii.You can also take the opportunity to add the initial value of your likes state to 0:

            const [likes, setLikes] = React.useState(0);

                    1. You cannot do likes++ because in React, state is considered read-only, so you should replace it rather than mutate your existing objects
                        - https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state, https://react.dev/reference/react/useState
                    2. When state changes, React re-renders the component.
                    3. You should always use the setter function to update your state.
                    4. If your new state value depends on the previous state, you can pass a function to the setter function:setLikes(prevLikes=> prevLikes +1);
